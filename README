Rhalostats
============
This plugin was made for myself to be used with my own Halo 3 Players
Facebook application. It's used to scrape and store data from bungie.net
about a gamertag's Halo 3 stats.

I haven't done any extra work to make it simple for an end user to pick 
up and plug in to their Rails application so use at your own risk. I may
get around to improving end-user usability in the future.
